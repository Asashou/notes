## Intro

- visual neuroscience and electrophysiology
- joined Laura Busse's lab, work on mouse vision and behaviour, while recording neurophysiology and doing optogenetic manipulation
- my python experience:
    - needed visual stimulus presentation program
    - found VisionEgg, written in Python by a neuroscientist/entomologist, flexibility, features we needed, and it was free!
    - Python was the first open-source thing I'd used, eventually switched from windows to linux
- also use python for:
    - neural spike sorting & data analysis
    - database system for storing all our lab data
    - simpler things like renaming a bunch of files/folders in nested hierarchy
    - arithmetic, simple calculations instead of a calculator
- motivation:
    - example: load data, analyze, plot, save

- why Programming/coding?
    - of those who don't know any programming, how do you analyze your data?
    - probably excel, which is a mini language
    - programming gives you the flexibility of doing just about anything with your data, or any data
        - use lots of small building blocks, combine them in infinite ways
        - trick is to learn which blocks to use, and when, and how best to combine them
        - can launch spaceships or give robots the ability to learn or swing the outcome of an election, can't do that with Excel

- why Python?
    - War on Science
        - science is under attack, mostly corporate but also philosophical
    - making science more open:
        - open data, open publication, and open code
        - http://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html
    - Python isn't just free, it's open source: code behind Python and all of its libraries can be inspected, modified, improved by anyone
        - compare with Matlab
    - code written in Python is by default open, because there's no compilation as in other languages
    - Python is used more outside of science and engineering than within it - giving it a huge, general user base, makes it easy to find answers to problems
    - Python has been growing in popularity over many years, now ranked #1 depending on how you measure it - see charts at https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/
    - fits your brain - Python syntax is intuitive, often reads like English
    - batteries included - lots and lots of tools built in, and endless more that can be installed
        - bit like toolboxes in Matlab, but free and open
    - makes you employable
    - small, on disk and in memory
    - quick to start up compared to matlab

- quick intros: name, status, programming background, data analysis wants/needs
- help each other out
- integrated lecture + in-class exercises
    - lecture: introduce concepts, exercise class: practice the concepts
- grades:
    - attendance: 25%, all or nothing
        - can miss up to 3 out of 12 classes, any more and no credit
    - homework: 25%, probably 4 homework assignments, fairly short, graded by attempt, not outcome. We'll go over solutions the following week
    - programming is a skill, like any other language, need to practice listening/speaking it, or in this case, reading/writing it, and also struggling and overcoming it
    - final project: 50%
        - meet list of requirements that are fairly easy to fulfill
        - code needs to run successfully
        - can work on it for part of last ~2 classes
