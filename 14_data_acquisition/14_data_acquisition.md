- acquire with microphone, then analyze waveforms
- psychophysics: psychopy? pyglet?
- voltages, analog & digital I/O
- sampling
    - resampling, interpolation
    - mention Nyquist theorem
- filtering
- generate audio?
- ctypes for interfacing with C libraries, i.e. device drivers? maybe too advanced, but
mention it
