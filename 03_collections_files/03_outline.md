- collections, files
    - aside: Ipython/Jupyter, installing packages
        - IPython
            - more IPython magicks
            - saving your IPy history
            - ipython_config.py file
            - ipython cheat sheet?
        - demo Jupyter notebook
        - installing packages/modules, just mention for familiarity's sake:
            - binaries, especially in windows
            - ubuntu/deb repos
            - from source code
            - pip
                - pip install --user
    - collections
        - sequences
            - tuples
                - declare with `t = (value, value...)` or `t = value, value...`
                    - often the parentheses are optional
                - tuple expansion allows for multiple assignment:
                    - `a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)` or simply `a, b, c = 1, 2, 3`
                - methods: `.count()`, `.index()`
                - tuples can be used to `return` multiple values from a function
            - lists
                - init with `[]` or `list()`
                - extra methods: `.append(value)`, `.clear()`,
                - delete entries with `del`
                - convert to a list with `list()`
                - `del` an entry
            - indexing
                - 0-based
                - negative indices denote distance from end
            - slicing
                - `a[starti:stopi]`
                - fencepost analogy, slicing from one fencepost to another, not from one slot
                to another
            - iterating over sequences
                - for loops: `for val in sequence:`
                    - `enumerate()`
                        - `for index, val in enumerate(sequence):`
                - list comprehension, good for doing repetitive things in a single line
                    - `doubledlist = [ 2*val for val in sequence ]`
            - functions: `min(), max(), mean(), sorted(), tuple(), list()`
        - dictionaries, aka "mappings"
            - init with `{}` or `dict()`
            - add new key:value pairs with `d[key] = value`
                - what happens if key already exists?
            - various methods
            - iterating over dicts:
                - dict comprehension
                - dict vs. ordered dict
        - combining tuples, lists, dicts, any combination is possible, can be deeply nested
            - common ones:
                - list of tuples
                - dict of lists
        - memory, value vs reference, mutability
            - `a = [1,2,3]; b = a` vs `a = [1,2,3]; b = a.copy()`
    - file operations
        - `with open(filename) as f`
            - file modes: `r`, `rb`, `w`, `wb`
            - text mode vs binary mode
            - open vs. closed files
                - what happens when you try and do something with f outside the with block?
        - `f.read()`, `f.readline()`
        - `f.write()`, newline character `\n`
        - `f.seek()`
        - `os.path.join()`, `split()`, `splitext()`
        - JSON format for data storage/exchange
            - human readable, easy for computers to parse, supported by lots of different
            programming languages
            - `json.dump(something)`, `load(f)`
