- collections, files
    - aside: Ipython/Jupyter, installing packages
        - IPython
            - more IPython magicks
            - saving your IPy history
            - ipython_config.py file
        - demo Jupyter notebook
        - installing packages/modules, just mention for familiarity's sake:
            - binaries, especially in windows
            - ubuntu/deb repos
            - from source code
            - pip
                - pip install --user
    - collections
        - sequences
            - tuples
                - tuple expansion
            - lists
            - indexing
                - -ve indices
            - slicing
                - :
            - iterating over sequences
                - for loops
                    - `enumerate()`
                - list comprehension
            - `min(), max(), mean(), sort(), sorted(), tuple(), list()`
        - dicts - "mappings"
            - various methods
            - iterating over dicts:
                - dict comprehension
                - dict vs. ordered dict
        - memory, value vs reference, mutability
    - file operations
        - `with open(filename) as f`
            - file modes: `r`, `rb`, `w`, `wb`
            - text mode vs binary mode
            - open vs. closed files
                - what happens when you try and do something with f outside the with block?
        - `f.read()`, `f.readline()`
        - `f.write()`, newline character `\n`
        - `f.seek()`
        - `os.path.join()`, `split()`, `splitext()`
        - JSON format for data storage/exchange
            - human readable, easy for computers to parse, supported by lots of different
            programming languages
            - `json.dump(something)`, `load(f)`
