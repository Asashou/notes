- sort a list of numbers, strings, mix of numbers and strings (what happens?)
- reverse sorted list
- make multiple references to a list, use one of those references to modify the list
    - what do you predict will happen? what actually happens? how can you make the references
    point to separate lists?
- try and modify an existing tuple, what happens? how can you accomplish this?
    - need to create a new tuple instead
- take dict, return its sorted keys
    - use sorted keys to get matching values, organize keyvals in a list of tuples, sorted by
    key
- file stuff
    - write script that takes `input()`, writes it to file whose name is also queried using
    `input()`
    - convert user querying script so that it saves user input to a dict, then saves that to a
    .json file, whose file name is also queried from the user
