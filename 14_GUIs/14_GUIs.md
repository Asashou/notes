- file selection dialogs
- buttons/comboboxes/radio buttons/sliders/text boxes
- QtDesigner? .ui files?
- maybe jump to PyQt5?

- `from ipywidgets import interact`
    - `interact` is a decorator
    - takes a function, and makes sliders out of the function's arguments
    - see data viz talk by Stihl
