### Python basics 2

- review
    - `==` vs `=`
    - while loops
    - `elif` clause in for loops, in addition to `else` clause
    - running python scripts from command line
    - write a loop, either a for loop or a while loop, that prints "hello" 3 times, then prints "hello?" 3 times, then prints "goodbye!" once
- plain text editors
    - key features: fixed-width font, syntax highlighting, line numbering
    - linux: geany, gedit, mousepad
    - windows: geany, notepad++, ultraedit, textpad
    - mac: geany, notepad++, atom, sublime, xcode
    - command line editor: nano, even cat
    - xplatform Python IDEs: pycharm, spyder
        - downside: maybe don't work as well for other types of languages or text files
- coding style: why does it matter? easier to read, understand, debug
    - try reading a book without paragraphs...
    - a few tips from coding style guide
        - PEP 8: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>
        - variable assignment: always leave a space on either side of `=`
- strings
    - string formatting, operations and functions
        - combine strings with `+`
        - duplicate strings with `*`
        - whitespace characters: `\n` and `\t`
        - `%` string replacement operator
            - what else does `%` do? how does python know whether to use it as a string
            replacement operator or as mod operator?
            - format strings act as placeholders: `%s, %d, %f, %g`
        - `.split(), .format(), .replace(), .strip(), .upper(), .lower()`
- are there other string methods, how to discover them without doing a web search?
    - use `dir(something)`
- IPython as replacement for plain Python interpreter
    - `something?` for help, `something??` for help plus source code, if available
    - command completion
    - attribute exploration via dot notation, followed by ?
    - referring to previous outputs and inputs with `_` and `_i`
    - view all local variables with `whos`
    - paste multiline code from editor directly into IPython
- comments, docstrings
    - single line: `#`
    - multiline: `"""..."""` or  `'''...'''`
    - why comment? what makes a good comment?
        - another form of commenting: choose descriptive variable names, use them consistently
        - what happens if you change code without updating comment? confusion!
- built-ins/keywords
    - listed in `help(), keywords`
    - can't be used as variable names
- calling functions
    - what is a function?
    - what are function arguments?
    - remind of `math` module, how do you gain access to it?
    - `help(function)` or `function?` to get call signature
    - functions can have a fixed or variable number of arguments, some of which are optional
    - positional arguments: `function(a, b) != function(b, a)`
    - keyword arguments `function(a=value1, b=value2)` can be specified in any order
    - use `datetime.date()` to demonstrate
        - `datetime.date(2005, 5, 2)`
        - `datetime.date(month=5, year=2005, day=2)`
- defining your own functions:
    - `def functionname(arguments):`
    - documentation string
    - `return` a value, or multiple values separated by comma
    - defining positional and keyword arguments
    - "functional programming"
    - variable scope/namespaces
- errors and debugging
    - typical errors: `SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, ValueError, RuntimeError,
    AttributeError`
    - `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`
        - debugger commands: `l, w, s, n`
    - `try, except` blocks to catch specific types of errors and deal with them
    - `assert` allows you to check assumptions that might not always hold
    - `raise` your own errors to stop execution and inform the user of something
