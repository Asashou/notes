- Python basics 2
    - aside on editors with syntax highlighting and line numbering
        - linux: geany, gedit, mousepad
        - windows: geany, notepad++, ultraedit, textpad
        - mac: geany, notepad++, atom, sublime, xcode
        - command line editor: nano, even cat
        - xplatform Python IDEs: pycharm, spyder
            - downside: maybe don't work as well for other types of languages or text files
    - strings
        - string formatting, operations and functions
            - combine strings with `+`
            - duplicate strings with `*`
            - whitespace characters: ` `, `\n` and `\t`
            - `%` string replacement operator
                - what else does `%` do? how does python know whether to use it as a string
                replacement operator or as mod operator?
                - format strings act as placeholders: `%s, %d, %f, %g`
            - `.split(), .format(), .replace(), .strip(), .upper(), .lower()`
    - are there other string methods, how to discover them without doing a web search?
        - use `dir(something)`
        - intro IPython instead of plain Py interpreter
            - ? help
            - command completion
            - attribute exploration via dot notation, followed by ?
            - referring to previous outputs and inputs with `_` and `_i`
            - view all local variables with `whos`
            - paste multiline code from editor directly into IPython
    - comments, docstrings
        - single line: `#`
        - multiline: `"""..."""` or  `'''...'''`
        - why comment? what makes a good comment?
            - another form of commenting: choose descriptive variable names, use them
            consistently
    - built-ins/keywords
        - listed in `help(), keywords`
        - can't be used as variable names
    - importing
        - math package to introduce functions
    - calling functions
        - what is a function?
        - what are function arguments?
        - `help(function)` or `function?` to get call signature
        - functions can have a fixed or variable number of arguments, some of which are optional
        - positional arguments: `function(a, b) != function(b, a)`
        - keyword arguments `a=value1, b=value2` can be specified in any order
        - use `datetime.datetime()` to demonstrate?
    - defining your own functions:
        - `def functionname(arguments):`
        - documentation string
        - `return` a value, or multiple values separated by comma
        - defining positional and keyword arguments
        - "functional programming"
    - errors and debugging
        - typical errors: `SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, ValueError, RuntimeError,
        AttributeError`
        - `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`
            - debugger commands: l, w, s, n
        - `try, except` blocks to catch specific types of errors and deal with them
        - `assert` allows you to check assumptions that might not always hold
        - `raise` your own errors to stop execution and inform the user of something
