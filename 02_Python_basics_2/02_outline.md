- Python basics 2
    - aside on editors with syntax highlighting and line numbering
        - linux: geany, gedit, mousepad
        - windows: geany, notepad++, ultraedit, textpad
        - mac: geany, notepad++, atom, sublime, xcode
        - command line editor: nano, even cat
        - xplatform Python IDEs: pycharm, spyder
            - downside: maybe don't work as well for other types of languages or text files
    - strings
        - string formatting, operations and functions
            - % string replacement operator
                - what else does % do? how does python know whether to use it as a string replacement operator or as mod operator?
                - placeholders: `%s, %d, %f, %g`
            - `split, format, replace, strip, upper, lower`
    - are there other string methods, how to discover them without doing a web search?
        - intro IPython instead of plain Py interpreter
            - ? help
            - command completion
            - attribute exploration via dot notation
            - referring to previous inputs and outputs

        - single and multiline
        - what makes a good comment?
    - built-ins/keywords
    - importing
        - math package to introduce functions
    - calling functions
        - `help(function)` or `function?` to get call signature
        - fixed or variable number of arguments
        - positional arguments (indicated by / in help docstring)
        - keyword arguments
        - use `datetime.datetime()` to demonstrate?
    - errors and debugging
        - `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`
            - debugger commands: l, w, s, n
        - `try, except`
        - `assert`
