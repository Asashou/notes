## Intro

- visual neuroscience and electrophysiology
- joined Laura Busse's lab, work on mouse vision and behaviour, while recording neurophysiology and doing optogenetic manipulation
- my python experience:
    - needed visual stimulus presentation program
    - found VisionEgg, written in Python by a neuroscientist/entomologist, flexibility, features we needed, and it was free!
    - not just free, open source: code can be inspected and modified by anyone, if desired
    - Python was the first open-source thing I'd used, eventually switched from windows to linux
- also use python for:
    - neural spike sorting & data analysis
    - database system for storing all our lab data
    - simpler things like renaming a bunch of files/folders in nested hierarchy
    - arithmetic, simple calculations instead of a calculator
- motivation:
    - example: load data, analyze, plot, save
- quick intros: name, status, programming background, data analysis wants/needs
- helping each other out
- course is lecture + exercise class (Nick)
    - lecture: introduce concepts, exercise class: practice the concepts
- grades:
    - attendance: 30%, all or nothing
        - can miss up to 3 out of 14 days, any more and no credit
    - participation in both lecture and exercise class: 30%
        - good, mediocre, none: 100%, 50%, 0%
    - final project: 40%
        - meet list of requirements that are fairly easy to fulfill
        - code needs to run successfully
        - work on it during last 2 or 3 exercise classes
    - no homework! but programming is a skill, like any other language, need to practice listening/speaking it, or in this case, reading/writing it
