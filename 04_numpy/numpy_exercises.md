# Homework 4: Working with Numpy Arrays

### Exercise: Converting lists to arrays

Convert the list [3, 6, 2] to an array.

### Exercise: Converting tuples to arrays

Convert the tuple (2.1, 5.4, 2.0) to an array.

### Exercise: dtype

What is the data type of the array from the previous two exercises?

### Exercise: changing the dtype

Convert an array of integers to floats.  (__Hint__: astype())

### Exercise: How big is the array?

Get the number of values in a given array.

### Exercise: arange() and linspace()

  - Make an array of floats with all the values from 0 to 40.

  - Make an array of 5 evenly-spaced values between the numbers 1 and 4.

### Math Exercises:

Using the array from the previous exercise:

  1. Double the values

  2. Add 100 to the values
  3. Calculate the square root of the values.
  4. Find the mean of the array.
  5. Find the standard deviation (std) of the array.

### Appending Arrays

Append the array [1, 2] and [3, 4] together to make a single array, [1, 2, 3, 4]
