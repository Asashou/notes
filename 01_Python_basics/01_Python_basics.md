### Python basics

- motivation:
    - example: load data, analyze, plot, save
- bash command line basics, assume git bash installed on windows
    - bash = "Bourne-Again SHell"
    - `cd, ls, mv, cp, rm, mkdir, touch, cat`
    - specifying paths: `/`, `.`, `..`, `~`, `-`
    - `man` and `--help` for help
    - up/down arrow keys to access recently used commands
    - quickly view file contents using `cat filename`
    - save text output of a command to file using redirection:
        - `ls > file_list.txt`
        - `cat > shopping_list.txt`
            - Ctrl+D on a blank line to finish writing to file
        - append to a file with `cat >>`, e.g. `cat >> shopping_list.txt`
        - redirection overwrites any existing file!
- python interpreter
    - interpreted vs compiled languages
    - calculator, math operators
    - up/down arrow keys to access recently used commands
    - `print('hello world!')`
        - functions: take some kind of input, generate some kind of output
    - `s = input('prompt: ')`
- make hello world script, run from command line
    - `python hello.py`
- variable assignment
    - `a = 1`
    - multiple assignments on a single line (tuple expansion): `a, b = 1, 2`
- help
    - in Python interpreter: `help(something)`
        - `q` to exit
    - online: search, StackExchange, or official `http://docs.python.org`
- basic Python data types
    - `int, float, str, bool`
        - types also are functions that convert input to that type
        - literals: `1, 1.0, '1', True`
    - `None`
    - division always gives float, unless `//` (div)
        - find remainder using mod operator `%`
    - using `type()`
- flow control:
    - comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
        - compare multiple values at once: `a < b < c...`
    - boolean logic with `and`, `or`, `not`
    - `if` statements, each clause on a separate line
        - `if a == 1:`
        - `elif`, `else`
        - compact one-line version:
            - `a =` val1 `if` condition `else` val2
    - shortcut: assign one of two values based on truth test of first value
        - `a = val1 or val2`
            - assign `val1` if `bool(val1)` evaluates to True, otherwise assign `val2`
    - `for` loops
        - `for i in range(10):`
        - `range(n)` generates values 0 to n-1
        - `range(3, n)` generates values 3 to n-1
        - `break`, `continue`
    - `while` loops
        - `while a > 1:`
        - same as `for` loops, except you manually increment your variable as you like
    - use of indentation to define blocks
        - tabs vs spaces, check your editor

- coding style: why does it matter? easier to read, understand, debug
    - try reading a book without paragraphs!
    - a few tips from coding style guide
        - PEP 8: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>
        - assignment always leaves a space on either side of `=`
