### Python basics

- motivation:
    - example: load data, analyze, plot, save
- command line basics, assume git bash installed on windows
    - `cd, ls, mv, cp, rm, mkdir, touch, cat`
    - specifying paths: `/`, `.`, `..`, `~`, `-`
    - `man` and `--help` for help
    - up/down arrow keys to access recently used commands
    - save text output of a command to file using redirection:
        - `ls > file_list.txt`
        - `cat > shopping_list.txt`
            - Ctrl+D on a blank line to finish writing to file
        - append to a file with `cat >>`, e.g. `cat >> shopping_list.txt`
        - redirection overwrites any existing file!
        - view a file using `cat filename`
- py interpreter
    - interpreted vs compiled languages?
    - calculator, math operators
    - up/down arrow keys to access recently used commands
    - `print('hello world')`
        - intro to functions: take input, generate output
            - graphical/math representation: single input, single output; horizontal U is
            technically not a function
    - `input()`
- make hello world script, run from command line
    - `python scriptname.py`
- variable assignment
    - multiple assignments on a single line (tuple expansion)
- help
    - in Python interpreter: `help(something)`
    - online
- basic Python data types
    - `int, float, str, bool`
        - types also are functions that convert input to that type
        - literals: `1, 1.0, '1', True`
    - `None`
    - division always gives float, unless `//` (div)
        - find remainder using mod operator %
    - using `type()`
- flow control:
    - `if` statements
        - `elif`, `else`
        - boolean logic with `and`, `or`, `not`
    - `for` loops
        - tabs vs spaces, check your editor
        - `range()`
        - `break`, `continue`
    - `while` loops
- a few tips from coding style guide
    - PEP 8: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>
    - why does coding style matter? easier to read, understand, debug
        - like trying to read a book without paragraphs
