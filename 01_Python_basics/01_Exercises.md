# Introduction to Scientific Programming with Python

## Workshop 1: The Terminal and Python Syntax

**Instructions**: Complete the following 3 exercises by making the scripts described.  Email the finished scripts to **delgrosso@bio.lmu.de** at the end of the session to get credit.  I'll help guide you all through the process, but be sure to do some exploring on your own as well--often that's when things "click"!

### Exercise 1: The Bash Terminal

**Learning Goal**: Become familiar with the bash terminal and the commands for navigating the filesystem.

-Learn the commands: **cd**, **ls**, **head**, **tail**, **mv**, **cp**, **touch**
  
-Know how to look up the help documentation for bash commands.
  
-Understand the way a fiesystem is organized and how to traverse it.
  
-Understand the difference bgetween an absolute and relative path
  
-Know how to write and run a bash script
   
-(Optional): Recognize some bash tricks, like pipes.

**Exercise Goal**: Write a Bash Script that Creates New Files and Subfolders in a Folder

1.Create an "Experiment" directory (mkdir)
  
2.Put 3 directories in that directory: "Scripts", "Data", "Results"
  
3.Put 3 empty files in the data folder: "exp1.txt", "exp2.txt", and "exp3.txt"
  
4.Write a Bash script that does the previous steps for you when it is run.
    

  
### Exercise 2: Python Syntax

**Learning Goal**: Understand how to open the IPython interactive terminal and how to create variables, loops, and if-else statements in it, and how to write and run a python script.  
  
-Know How to create variables
    
-Recognize the different data types, and what they are used for (int, float, str, bool)
    
-Know the **print()** and **input()** functions and be able to use them.
    
-Know what an if-else block is used for and how to write one in Python
    
-Know what while loop  is used for and how to write one in Python
    
-Know what a for loop  is used for and how to write one in Python
    
-Know how to import Python modules and use functions inside them, and how to get the help documentation for the function.
  

### Exercise 3: Python Syntax: Exploring a Module and the Methods of Objects

  
**Learning Goal**: Explore the functions in a new module and practice using logical thinking to solve problems.

**Exercise Goal**: Use Python's **turtle** module to make scripts draw some geometric shapes!

-import the **turtle** module
    
-create a **Screen** and a **Turtle**.
    
-Tell the turtle to move around the screen using its movement methods: **forward(), left(), right(), backward()**
    
-Use the turtle to draw a triangle
    
-Use the turtle to draw a bigger trinalge
    
-Draw a square.
